In Mastermind, a code is a sequence (list) of colors. The player enters what they think the sequence is, and then the game gives the player feedback on how accurate their guess is (more on this below). They then use this information to make a new, more informed guess, and the process repeats. The game ends when the player enters the correct sequence or they run out of guesses (a win/loss, respectively), and the correct sequence is revealed to the player.
